        So you're ready to
        <strong>
          <em>***CRACK THE CODE***</em>
        </strong>
        , {userName}? Before you go tryin' there are some rules to that finnicky
        safe. I'll fill you in:
        <div>
          <strong>
            <em>=RULES=</em>
          </strong>
          * You will have unlimited chances to try and choose the correct
          combination of colors. * Choose amongst the nine (9) colors
          under each white square ‚¨ú . <em> psst...white is ALSO a color! </em>*
          You will be timed ‚è±Ô∏è, so make sure to
          <strong>
            <em>***CRACK THE CODE***</em>
          </strong>
          soon! * The Safe gives you some clues to let you know how you're
          doing. Each symbol after your entry means something:
          <div>
            ‚ùå : No colors were correct. üò¨ : Only one (1) of the colors was
            correct. üî• : Two (2) of the colors are correct. üåü : SUCCESS!
          </div>
          If you forget the rules while you're tryin', don't worry: I'll keep the rules posted for ya when ya get started {userName}!
        </div>
        <img src={profilePic} alt="Player" />
      </span>
    );
}

export default IntroRulesBox;
