          <em> ***CRACK THE CODE***</em>

        , {userName}? Before you go tryin' there are some rules to that finnicky
        safe. I'll fill you in: 
        </p>
          <strong>
            <em>=RULES=</em>
          </strong>
          <p>* You will have unlimited chances to try and choose the correct
          combination of colors. </p>
          <p>* Choose amongst the nine (9) colors
          under each white square ‚¨ú . <em> psst...white is ALSO a color! </em>*
          You will be timed ‚è±Ô∏è, so make sure to
          <strong>
            <em> ***CRACK THE CODE*** </em>
          </strong>
          soon! </p>
          <p>* The Safe gives you some clues to let you know how you're
          doing. Each symbol after your entry means something: </p>
          <p>‚ùå : No colors were correct.</p>
          <p>üò¨ : Only one (1) of the colors was</p>
          <p>üî• : Two (2) of the colors are correct.</p>
          <p>üåü : SUCCESS!</p>
          If you forget the rules while you're tryin', don't worry: I'll keep the rules posted for ya when ya get started {userName}!
