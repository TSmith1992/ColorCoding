      So you're ready to
      <strong>
        <em>***CRACK THE CODE***</em>
      </strong>
      , {userName}? Before you go tryin' there are some rules to that finnicky
      safe. I'll fill you in:
      <div><strong><em>=RULES=</em></strong>
      * You will have three (5) chances to try and choose the correct combination of colors. {"\n"}
      * Choose amongst the nine (9) colors under each white square ‚¨ú . <em>  psst...white is ALSO a color! </em> 
      * You will be timed ‚è±Ô∏è, so make sure to <strong><em>***CRACK THE CODE***</em></strong> soon!
      * The Safe gives you some clues to let you know how you're doing. Each symbol after your entry means something:
      <div>
      ‚ùå : No colors were correct.
      üò¨ : Only one (1) of the colors was correct.
      üî• : Two (2) of the colors are correct.
      ‚ú® : All the colors are correct, but not in the right order.
      üåü : SUCCESS!
      </div>
      If you forget the rules while you're tryin', just gimme a ring and I'll remind you! Good luck, {userName}!
      </div>
      <img src={profilePic} alt="Player"/>
      <button className ="rulesButton">
          {userName==="rulesButton"? "Go back to safe" : "Go ask the Safe Guard"}
      </button>
